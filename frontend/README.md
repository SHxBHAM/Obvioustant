# Frontend - Obvioustant

Welcome to the frontend, where we make things pretty and pretend the backend doesn't exist.

## Stack
- **React + Vite** – Because waiting for Webpack to bundle is for chumps.
- **TailwindCSS** – Writing normal CSS is suffering.
- **ShadCN** – Because UI should be easy.

## Setup & Running

### 1. Install dependencies
```
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Start the dev server
```
npm run dev
```

If everything worked, open `http://localhost:5173` and bask in the glory of your own voice turning into text.

## Features
- Speech-to-text transcription that may or may not understand you.
- Auto-extracts tasks, events, and notes from your nonsense.
- Dark mode, because obviously.

## Issues & Fixes
- **Speech recognition isn’t working** – Are you on Chrome? No? There’s your problem.
- **Nothing appears on screen** – Did you run the backend? Didn’t think so.
- **Everything is ugly** – Tailwind is your friend. Embrace it.

## Notes
- This frontend is useless without the backend. Don’t forget to start that too.
- The UI might look decent, but deep down, it's all just divs and vibes.
- If you break something, blame JavaScript.

Good luck, and may your console stay error-free!
